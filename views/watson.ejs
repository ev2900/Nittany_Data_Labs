    						Student run analytics club which teaches students technical skills over a semester long training program. Contextulizes knowledge gained in training program by working on real world consulting projects the following semester. <br>
							
							We are very serious about this competition. In fact, for this semester alone, instead of consulting project we are committed to working on the five (5) proposal projects we submitted for the IBM Watson/PSU EdTech Network Challenge. <br>

							Our core team of project managers and technical leaders are individuals with years of project experience. We will also supplement these individuals with 5-10 auxiliary members per team to ensure adequate manpower to complete all funded proposals. Some facts about these auxiliary members are highlighted below: <br>
