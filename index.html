			<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-e16e456d-bdeb-2bef-e750-f1145acc0cbf">

				Nittany Data Labs is an organization poised for growth. With the onset of the 21st century we are in the mists of an information revolution. Google indexes over 3 billion webpages a day. Countless devices both fixed and mobile generated tremendous amounts of data each day. Organizations continue to collect data with single organizations having up to and sometimes above petabytes of data stored. Within a sea of information which grows with each moment how does an organization navigate theses seas? How can emerging technologies be leveraged and what questions can we ask to reach greater incites and discover meaning? <br>

				<br>

				Nittany Data Labs represents some of the finniest ideas and implementations of big data projects at Penn State. An entirely student run group students within the group spend time exploring existing and emerging technologies. Wrestle with concepts and ideas related to Hadoop, machine learning and data visualization. Working on a variety of project within Penn State and outside of Happy Valley, Nittany Data Labs leverages these taught skills to make a difference working on actually projects partnered with a variety or other business and organizations. Nittany Data Labs aims to push the envelope with respect to what is possible within the realm of analytics and business integration.

			<h4 style="color: #FF913F">What We Do</h4>
			<h2 style="color: #7e7e7e; font-size: 35px"> Our Amazing Projects</h2>
            <p> 

            	We are diving into three major projects and a variety of minor projects. Our three major projects are in partnership with Penn State food services. The three projects cover three major areas with in analytics. Data visualization, predictive modeling and business integration. The first project is a data visualization project related to visualizing temperature data collected by food services. The project will help ensure the safety of our food and will utilize technologies such as MongoDB, AngularJS, Express.js and Node.js to build an application for visualization. Our second project is a predictive modeling project related to predicting the demand of perishable good which are bought often by Penn State. This project will help prevent waste and help food services operate more efficiently. This project will utilize machine learning in the context of Weka and possibly Hadoop specifically HBase and Mahout. Our last project is a business integration project. Shipping purchased food from different vendor food services has to coordinate the transition of food the campus after its purchase. Thus a large optimization problem for the most cost effective method of transportation exists. In a possible partnership with the Nittany Consulting group we hope to optimize transportation operations. 

            	<br><br> 

            	Working on these projects we are looking for awsome people!
            	<br><br>
            	We are currently filling the following roles: 

            	<br><br> 

            	<span style="color:#FF913F">Deployment Strategist- Business Skills & Project Management</span>

            	<br> 

            	Analytics can’t exist in a vacuum. Novel insights are derived from understanding both the data and the context setting surrounding it. Deployment strategists will work with the client on defining user needs, project scope, and development timelines. They will compile descriptive information on the dataset, how information is captured, and the features of analysis that would be most valuable for the given application. Client relationship and project management skills are preferable.

            	<br> <br> 

            	<span style="color:#FF913F">Development Engineer- Coding Skills in R, Python, Databases, ML, STAT</span>
            	
            	<br>

            	Analytics requires a deep understanding of both the problem and the tools available to solve it. Deployment engineers will be coding, exploring large data sets, testing scripts, and ultimately delivering the analytics interface. A wide range of skills may be valuable for this position including: programming skills in R, Python, SQL, noSQL; machine learning and algorithm development techniques; and statistics. 

            	<br><br>
